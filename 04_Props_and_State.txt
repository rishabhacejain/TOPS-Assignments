Question 1: What are props in React.js? How are props different from state?

In React, props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, making components reusable and dynamic. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the receiving component, ensuring that data flows in a unidirectional manner. They are passed as attributes in JSX, like <Greeting name="Rishabh" />, and accessed inside the component using {props.name}. In contrast, state is managed within a component and can be updated using setState() in class components or useState() in functional components. State allows a component to track and modify its own data dynamically, enabling features like user interactions, form inputs, and real-time updates. Unlike props, which remain constant unless changed by the parent, state can be modified internally, triggering a re-render of the component. For example, in a counter component, state would store the current count and update it when a button is clicked. This key difference—props being immutable and controlled externally, while state is mutable and managed internally—defines how components handle data and rendering. By combining props for data flow and state for component-specific changes, React enables the creation of efficient and interactive user interfaces.

Question 2: Explain the concept of state in React and how it is used to manage component data.
In React, state is a built-in object that holds data specific to a component and determines how it renders and behaves. Unlike props, which are passed from a parent component and remain immutable, state is mutable and managed internally within a component. When the state of a component changes, React automatically triggers a re-render, ensuring that the UI updates dynamically based on the latest data. In functional components, state is managed using the useState hook, where const [count, setCount] = useState(0); initializes a state variable and an updater function. In class components, state is defined in the constructor using this.state and updated with this.setState(). For example, a simple counter component may use state to track and update the count when a button is clicked. The key advantage of state is that it enables components to respond to user interactions, store temporary data, and manage UI updates efficiently without requiring a full page reload. Since state updates are asynchronous, using a callback function inside setState() ensures consistency when updating values based on the previous state. By leveraging state effectively, React applications become more dynamic, interactive, and responsive to user inputs.

Question 3: Why is this.setState() used in class components, and how does it work?

In React class components, this.setState() is used to update the component’s state and trigger a re-render. Unlike directly modifying this.state, which does not cause the UI to update, setState() ensures that React processes state changes efficiently. It merges the new state with the existing state and schedules a re-render to reflect the updated data. Since state updates are asynchronous, relying on the previous state requires using a callback function, like this.setState((prevState) => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));, to ensure accuracy. Multiple state updates may be batched together to optimize performance, preventing unnecessary renders. For example, in a counter component, calling this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }) updates the count and re-renders the UI. Additionally, setState() can accept a second argument, a callback function that runs after the state update is completed. This method plays a crucial role in managing dynamic data, ensuring smooth updates in interactive components. Unlike the useState hook in functional components, which directly updates state within functions, setState() is specific to class components, providing controlled state management and enhancing React’s reactive rendering mechanism.
