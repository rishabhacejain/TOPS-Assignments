Question 1: Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following
elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead>.

An HTML table is used to display data in a structured, grid-like format with rows and columns. It is created using the <table> element, which acts as the container for all table-related elements.

<table>: This element defines the entire table structure. It serves as the container for rows, headers, and data cells, ensuring the table is displayed correctly in the browser.

<tr> (Table Row): The <tr> element represents a single row within the table. It groups together header or data cells that belong in the same row.

<th> (Table Header): The <th> element defines header cells within a table, typically used in the first row or column. Header cells are bold and centered by default, helping to describe the type of data in their corresponding rows or columns.

<td> (Table Data): The <td> element defines individual data cells in the table. It is used to display the actual data and appears within a <tr> element.

<thead> (Table Header Group): The <thead> element is used to group all header rows within a table, separating them from the rest of the table data. It improves readability and supports table accessibility and styling.

By combining these elements, an HTML table can effectively organize and display tabular data.

Question 2: What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide
examples

In HTML tables, colspan and rowspan are attributes used to merge cells, but they serve different purposes:

colspan: This attribute is used to merge multiple columns into a single cell. It allows a cell to span across several columns horizontally, helping to create wider cells. For example, <td colspan="3"> merges three columns into one cell. It is useful for creating table headers or emphasizing data across multiple columns.
Example:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="3">Merged Header</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>



rowspan: This attribute is used to merge multiple rows into a single cell. It allows a cell to span vertically across several rows. For instance, <td rowspan="2"> merges two rows into one cell. It is useful for grouping data that applies to multiple rows.
Example:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Merged Row</td>
        <td>Data 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

So basically colspan merges cells horizontally, while rowspan merges cells vertically, allowing for flexible and organized table layouts.

Question 3 : Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better
alternative?

Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because they were originally designed for displaying tabular data, not for arranging page elements. When used for layout, tables can lead to several issues:

Accessibility: Tables meant for layout can confuse screen readers and assistive technologies, as they expect tables to contain data, not structural elements. This can result in a poor user experience for individuals with disabilities.

Complexity: Table-based layouts can be difficult to manage and maintain, especially when pages become more complex or need to be responsive. Modifying or resizing the layout can require significant changes to the table structure, making it less flexible.

Performance: Overusing tables for layout can lead to inefficient rendering by browsers, slowing down page load times, particularly on mobile devices or slower connections.

A better alternative to tables for layout purposes is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS provides a more flexible and efficient way to control the layout and design of a webpage. By using CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid, developers can create responsive and adaptive layouts without relying on tables. These methods are easier to implement, maintain, and scale, and they improve accessibility by clearly separating content from design.
