Q1. What are HTML forms used for? Describe the purpose of the input, textarea,
select, and button elements.

HTML forms are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. They allow users to interact with a webpage by submitting data, such as filling out contact information, making selections, or submitting feedback. Forms are essential for tasks like user registration, search functionality, or placing orders on e-commerce websites.

<input> Element:
The <input> element is used to create various types of input fields, such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, and passwords. It is the most versatile form element, allowing users to enter data in different formats. For example, <input type="text"> creates a text field, while <input type="password"> creates a password field.

<textarea> Element:
The <textarea> element is used to create a multi-line text box, allowing users to enter longer pieces of text, such as comments or messages. Unlike the <input> element, which is for single-line text, <textarea> is ideal for collecting larger text-based input, and its size can be adjusted using rows and columns attributes.

<select> Element:
The <select> element is used to create a dropdown menu where users can choose one or more options from a list. It contains <option> elements that define the selectable choices. This element is useful for situations where a limited set of predefined options needs to be presented, such as selecting a country or a product category.

<button> Element:
The <button> element is used to create clickable buttons within a form. It can be used to submit the form or trigger other actions such as resetting the form. The button can also include text or images to indicate its function, and it is customizable for styling and interaction purposes.

Q2. Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission.
When should each be used?

GET Method:
The GET method is used to send form data as part of the URL in the browserâ€™s address bar. It appends the data to the URL in the form of query parameters. This method is suitable for retrieving data or submitting simple, non-sensitive information, such as search queries or filters. Since the data is visible in the URL, GET is not recommended for sensitive information like passwords or personal details. It is ideal for operations that do not modify data on the server and where data needs to be cached or bookmarked.

POST Method:
The POST method submits form data in the body of the HTTP request, making it more secure than GET since the data is not exposed in the URL. POST is used when submitting sensitive or large amounts of data, such as user login credentials, form submissions with file uploads, or data that will modify or create new records on the server. It is the preferred method for actions that involve creating, updating, or deleting data.

When to Use Each:

GET: Use GET for requests that retrieve data and where the form submission does not involve sensitive information or cause changes on the server (e.g., search or filter forms).
POST: Use POST when the form submission involves sensitive data, large amounts of data, or actions that create, update, or delete resources on the server (e.g., registration, login, or file uploads).

Q3: What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve
accessibility?

The `<label>` element in a form is used to associate a text description with a specific form control, such as an input field, checkbox, radio button, or select menu. Its primary purpose is to help users understand the purpose of each form element by providing a clear and descriptive label.

For accessibility, the `<label>` element plays a vital role by enabling assistive technologies like screen readers to identify and announce the purpose of a form control. When a label is properly linked to an input element using the `for` attribute (which matches the input's `id`), users can click on the label to focus on the corresponding input field, improving navigation and usability. This feature is particularly beneficial for users with visual or motor impairments, ensuring a more inclusive user experience.
