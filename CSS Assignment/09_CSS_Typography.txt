Question 1: Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why
might you use a web-safe font over a custom font?
Answer:
Web-safe fonts are pre-installed on most devices and operating systems, ensuring consistent display across various
platforms without requiring additional downloads. Examples include Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New. Custom web
fonts, like those from Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts, are downloaded from a server and offer a broader range of styles and
design options.

Web-safe fonts are used for performance and compatibility, as they load quickly and don't rely on external resources.
Custom web fonts, while visually appealing, may increase page load times and require a fallback in case they fail to
load. Choosing between them depends on the balance between design aesthetics and performance needs.

Question 2: What is the font-family property in CSS? How do you apply a custom Google
Font to a webpage?

The font-family property in CSS specifies the typeface for text on a webpage. You can list multiple fonts as a fallback
system, with the browser using the first available one. For example:

font-family: 'Roboto', 'Arial', sans-serif;

To apply a custom Google Font, first, include the font's link in the <head> of your HTML from Google Fonts. For example:

    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

    Then, use the font in your CSS:

    body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    }

    This ensures the webpage uses the custom font if available, with fallback fonts as a backup.
